## Overview

In this repository, a function called `balance_sup_dem()` is created, and automatic unittests are defined using GitHub actions. unittest are defined using built-in python module `unittest` and executed using `pytest` package.

The function is created based on a code block used in [GIS Module](https://github.com/Emb3rs-Project/p-gis) of EMB3RS project. GIS Module's purpose within the EMB3RS platform is to analyze the network dimension and bring in the spatial dimension between sources and sinks. The application of the GIS is tailored for looking into the option of reusing the excess heat/cold at a certain distance within a District Heating and Cooling system. It calculates a network solution between a particular set of sources and sinks among the Open Street Map road network. The related investment costs into the grid and the corresponding heat/cold losses are calculated based on that network solution.

`balance_sup_dem()` function's aim is to balance the total supply and the total demand. This is required because of the balanced network assumption of the optimization model. In other words, `balance_sup_dem()` function is a preprocessing step needed for network optimization. If this balanced network assumption is not met, optimazation will fail, hence this step is critical.
